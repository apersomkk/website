			  <h3>10/4/2024</h3>
			  <p>I have nobody to relate to. Nobody that I have access to communication to has the ability to take my criticism. It's always deflected, to the point where I could make a better counter argument to my own claims than other people</p>
		  	  <h3>10/6/2024</h3>
			  <p>My primary goal in life is to have the most intelligence as possible and to be recognized as such. This goal is flawed, of course, because there is no good reason to be heavily recognized. It is either that my ambitions are unclear or that I just wish to not be considered unintelligent</p>

			  <p>i feel empty and at the same time i feel forced to keep going.</p>
